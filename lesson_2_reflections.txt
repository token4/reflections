What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Essentially, the folder you are working on becomes "git-ified". A .git folder gets added
	and the folder is now ready for commits. Git does not save a commit into the history yet
	You have to make your first commit before that happens.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where you add files that you want to put into your next commit. It
	servers as a draft before you are literally ready to 'commit'! This gives you more
	control as you can add files one at a time to this particular commit and view/edit them
	before you finish the action.
