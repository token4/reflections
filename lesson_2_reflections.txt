What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Essentially, the folder you are working on becomes "git-ified". A .git folder gets added
	and the folder is now ready for commits. Git does not save a commit into the history yet
	You have to make your first commit before that happens.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where you add files that you want to put into your next commit. It
	servers as a draft before you are literally ready to 'commit'! This gives you more
	control as you can add files one at a time to this particular commit and view/edit them
	before you finish the action.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	Even if you have made a couple of different logical changes, you can use the staging
	area to split your work back up. The functionality of git that allows you to explicitly
	choose which files to port over gives you another change to be explicit about logically
	splitting up your commits. You can do 'git diff' which compares the directory to the
	staging area to get a sense of what exactly has changed logically in this commit. Then,
	you can go on and do the rest.
