When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to share your work with colleagues, friends, or the open-source
	community to get feedback. Or, you could use a remote repository if you are working
	on different machines and are looking for a way to sync between them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	More control over your work. You should always have a sense of how far along your
	public Git repostiory is compared to your local Git folders. On the flip side, you
	may have local commits that aren't complete and you don't want to share with others
	yet which is why it's useful to have control over remote pushes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork: something you do only on Github to take an existing repository and bring it
	to your Github account so that you can make changes to it. This gives the original
	author credit for the work he/she had done up until that point, allows Github to
	track stats, and makes it easier for you to suggest changes back to the original
	author.

	Clones: you can clone a repo locally or on Github. The idea is that you'd clone a
	repo from Github locally to make changes or locally clone to start a new project
	which is very similar to the original.

	Branches: You can have branches of a repo locally or remotely. Branches are simply
	labeled commits that help you keep track of changes.
