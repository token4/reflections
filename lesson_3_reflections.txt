When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with colleagues, friends, or the open-source community
to get feedback. Or, you could use a remote repository if you are working on different
machines and are looking for a way to sync between them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

More control over your work. You should always have a sense of how far along your public
Git repostiory is compared to your local Git folders. On the flip side, you may have
local commits that aren't complete and you don't want to share with others yet which is
why it's useful to have control over remote pushes.
